Introduction

Develop an application using Ruby that solves the problem described below. The
aim of the problem is to allow the candidate to demonstrate their skill and
experience in aspects of the development process including domain modelling,
object orientated design, use of language constructs and idioms and testing
(unit or otherwise).

There is provided sample data to be used for testing and the candidate should be
able to demonstrate their solution using the supplied data in the form of a
command line interface and or unit test. Feel free to write the code however you
want, whether it's a gem, library, module etc.
Problem

Before submitting a credit card to a payment gateway it's important that we run
some sanity checks on the number.

A common check that is performed upfront is to validate the card type based on
the starting digits and length of card number. The main patterns that we care
about are as follows:

+============+=============+===============+
| Card Type  | Begins With | Number Length |
+============+=============+===============+
| AMEX       | 34 or 37    | 15            |
+------------+-------------+---------------+
| Discover   | 6011        | 16            |
+------------+-------------+---------------+
| MasterCard | 51-55       | 16            |
+------------+-------------+---------------+
| Visa       | 4           | 13 or 16      |
+------------+-------------+---------------+

All of these card types also generate numbers such that they can be validated by
the Luhn algorithm, so that's the second check systems usually try. The steps
are:

    Starting with the next to last digit and continuing with every other digit
going back to the beginning of the card, double the digit
    Sum all doubled and untouched digits in the number. For digits greater than
9 you will need to split them and sum the independently (i.e. "10", 1 + 0).
    If that total is a multiple of 10, the number is valid.

For example, given the card number 4408 0412 3456 7893:

1 8 4 0 8 0 4 2 2 6 4 10 6 14 8 18 3
2 8+4+0+8+0+4+2+2+6+4+1+0+6+1+4+8+1+8+3 = 70
3 70 % 10 == 0

Thus that card is valid.

Let's try one more, 4417 1234 5678 9112:

1 8 4 2 7 2 2 6 4 10 6 14 8 18 1 2 2
2 8+4+2+7+2+2+6+4+1+0+6+1+4+8+1+8+1+2+2 = 69
3 69 % 10 != 0

This card is not valid.
Task

Your task is to write a ruby program that accepts credit card numbers. Card
numbers must be passed in line by line (one set of numbers per line). The
program should print the card in the following format "TYPE: NUMBERS
(VALIDITY)".
Input and Output

Given the following credit cards:

4111111111111111
4111111111111
4012888888881881
378282246310005
6011111111111117
5105105105105100
5105 1051 0510 5106
9111111111111111

I would expect the following output:

VISA: 4111111111111111       (valid)
VISA: 4111111111111          (invalid)
VISA: 4012888888881881       (valid)
AMEX: 378282246310005        (valid)
Discover: 6011111111111117   (valid)
MasterCard: 5105105105105100 (valid)
MasterCard: 5105105105105106 (invalid)
Unknown: 9111111111111111    (invalid)
